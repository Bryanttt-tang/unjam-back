### The Exercise ###

This is a simple trajectory tracking exercise in a linear dynamical system, the system is defined as follows:

x(t+1) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)
y(t+1) = Cx(t+1)+Du(t)

where the matrices are defined as

    A =    [[1.01, 0.01, 0.00],
           [0.01,1.01,0.01],
           [0.00,0.01,1.01]]

    B = [[1,0,0],
         [0,1,0],
         [0,0,1]]
    
    C = [[1,0,0],
         [0,1,0],
         [0,0,1]]
    
    D = [[0,0,0],
         [0,0,0],
         [0,0,0]]

The reference trajectory is a vector full of ones of length p ( = 3)

The data is generated by a random input (to ensure the persistency of excitation) inside the generate_data() class in the generator file (line 39).

I encourage you to change the definition of this input to see what happens when breaking the assumptions of the algorithm once you solved the exercise.

The objectives are :

1. Implement the Hankel matrix class in the generator.py file
2. Implement the DeePC algorithm class in the generator.py file
3. run the simulation through the loop method of the DeePC class
4. Produce plots of the results
5. Challenge and break the assumptions of the algorithm to see what happens

The methods where the implementations are required are marked by a comment stating :

Good Luck!
